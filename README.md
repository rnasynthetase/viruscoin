##Why Viruscoin?

The intent behind Viruscoin was to take the bad rep away from Bitcoin.
For example: Bitcoins have been used in underground communities to pay for viruses and other potentially illegal goods.
The Viruscoin developers saw this as a threat to the future of Bitcoins (via attacks from mainstream media), so they created the Viruscoin as a substitute for those kind of transactions.
The Viruscoin is the only cryptocoin that isn't trying to compete with the already well established Bitcoin.

##Wait... Viruscoin seems like it should/could contain a virus. Should I be worried?

Not at all. The developers named it Viruscoin to deter the average Bitcoin "noob" from early adoption and encourage the Bitcoin users, that use Bitcoins for potentially illegal activities, to use Viruscoin instead for those frowned upon transactions.

There has been rumors of a virus put in this code, yet since its open source anyone can look at the code and determine for themselves.
We as the developers swear to never put any malicious code in Viruscoin. Also due to the way the community that supports virus distribution works, we doubt we could get a virus past them.

In a nutshell: Viruscoin is clean, and always will be. Once again... VIRUSCOIN IS CLEAN.
