This directory contains files used to package viruscoind/viruscoin-qt
for Debian-based Linux systems.

If you compile viruscoind/viruscoin-qt yourself, there are some
useful files here:

viruscoin: URI support
--------------------

viruscoin-qt.desktop  (Gnome / Open Desktop)
To install:
  sudo desktop-file-install viruscoin-qt.desktop
  sudo update-desktop-database

If you build yourself, you will either need to modify the paths in
the .desktop file or copy or symlink your viruscoin-qt binary to /usr/bin
and the ../../share/pixmaps/viruscoin128.png to /usr/share/pixmaps

viruscoin-qt.protocol (KDE)
